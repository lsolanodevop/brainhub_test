Brain Hub Test

First Part: In the beginning, we want you to create a simple app with frontend implemented in React.
Second Part: connected with a simple API written in Node.js with data saved in DB (e.g., MongoDB, PostgreSQL, SQLite, MySQL). 

Requirements: The application should allow a user to add an event to the database, with the following fields: 
● First name (required) 
● Last name (required) 
● Email (required, valid email address) 
● Event date (required, simple date picker) 
Essentials: 
● Tests for frontend and backend 
● Data validation on frontend and backend 
● Error handling 
● State management on frontend (form and request lifecycle state) ● Readme with all information needed to install and run the app, run tests ● Catalogs and components structure 
● Code readability and extensibility
